E Doktr isch, wer hett Idée? Zwiewele wie Bum-Bum! E vielgeblöjtes Menschekind; Zwiewele wie Bum-Bum! Ihm kläut'mr alles Leid un Weh Wenn irgend’s Mensche unwohl sinn. In’s Innere kann er zwar nit sähn, Zwiewele wie Bum-Bum! Un bstimme wo die Krankheit sitzt, Zwiewele wie Bum-Bum! Doch ich, ich gläub s’isch zu versteh’n, Mach’ immer, daß d'r Kranke schwitzt. Ja, schwitze isch e prachtvolls Universalmittel bie'n alle Kranke un hilft manchem Verzwiefelte widdr uff d’Bein. Leider gibt’s awr e so viel, wo d'Schwitzkürfür ebs ganz Gräßlichs halte, biem e Kranke un uewwer em Schaffe heißt’s, nur nit schwitze; awr biem Keijle, Esse un Trinke isch’s kenn Blöj, do geht’s. Ja, mit de Patiente hett m'r sini lieb Not, e jeder möcht ander’sch b’han- delt sin. Einer mit Mitleid, dr ander mit Grobheit, jener mit Medezin, zäller mit Wasser oder heißi Um- schläj, widdr anderi mit Iss oder Unterhaltung, un no sin noch do, die welle mit Ruej b’handelt sin, un mir Doktr muen uns immer noch de Lünne von de Kranke richte, des heißt also Geduld han.
