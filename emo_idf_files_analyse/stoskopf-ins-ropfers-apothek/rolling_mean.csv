 Herr Piefke, Auf Ihre Karte, dass mein
        Haarwuchsmittel Schwindel ist und Sie das Geld wieder zurückhaben wollen, kann ich nur
        antworten, dass ich vermute, dass Sie ein Schwindler sind. Mein Mittel hat noch auf allen
        anständigen Köpfen gewirkt, wenn dies bei Ihnen nicht der Fall ist, so nehme ich an, dass
        es vielleicht daher kommt, dass Ihr Hirn ausgetrocknet ist. Mit der Ihnen gebührenden
        Achtung. Antoine Ropfer, „pharmacien de première classe“.
