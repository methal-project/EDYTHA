          kumme! Jetz will i Abrechnung halte mit ere, wie zwische zwei Schweschtere noch kein Abrechnung
          ghalte-n-isch worre. Zue minere Menasch mueß sie m'r nüs, — un wenn sie später emol ellein, elend,
          verkomme un hilflos an mini Dhür klopft, verlosse vun ihre Kinder, wo verdorwe un gstorwe sin, wer weiß
          wo — — ze loß ich sie stehn wie e Hund . . . un wenn sie d'r Schlaa trefft uff minere Schwell, ich kenn
          sie nit, sterwe loß
          
ich sie wie e gemeini Bettlere, verrecke wie e grindigs Stück Vieh, wo m'r im Stall ken
          Platz meh gunnt. — Es gitt noch e gerechter Gott im Himmel. Do glauwi noch dran. — D'r Daa vun der
          Vergeltung bliet nit üs; un drno soll sie's am ayene Lib gspiere, was for e Leid sie m'r angedohn
          het.
