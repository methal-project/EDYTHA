Ja, ich hatte keine Ruhe nich und wollte dich un deine Eltern noch mal sehen. Als du auf die Welt
          kamst, da war ich hier im Elsass an der Post, ich ging dann nach Dräsden und fing eine
          Pferdewurstfabrik an. Jetzt in meinen alten Tagen da wollte ich doch Euch noch mal besuchen und da
          sagten mir deine Eltern, dass du hier in der rue de la liberté wohnst und Inspektor bist — na ja, und
          da bin ich nun — es freut mich, dass ich dich so frisch und munter angetroffen habe — ach ja !
