So hör! Ich gebe dir

                        
Mein Ehrenwort. Ich bin mit Lieschen nicht versprochen

                        
Auch nicht in sie verliebt. Es sind nun kaum sechs Wochen

                        
Seit Klärchen die du kennst zurück ist aus der Schweiz,

                        
Und schon hat für mein Herz ihr Umgang so viel Reitz,

                        
Ich bin so glücklich schon daß sie mir ist gewogen

                        
Und gut, fühl mich zu ihr so mächtig hingezogen,

                        
Daß ich für sie allein nun leben muß und will.

                        
Doch schüchtern allzusehr schwieg ich bisher noch still

                        
Und, meinen Eltern selbst verhehlend meine Liebe,

                        
Verbarg ich tief in mir den heftigsten der Triebe;

                        
Und diß Geständnis ist das erste. Bis du jezt

                        
Zufrieden? Glaubst du noch daß ich die Pflicht verlezt

                        
Der Freundschaft, die wir uns so lang schon zugeschworen,

                        
Un die mir heilig ist?

Des Zweifels Stacheln fand die er sich aufgesucht.

                        
Wohl macht die Liebe blind! Wie konnt ich den verkennen

                        
Den ich so lange schon den treu’sten Freund darf nennen!

                        
Doch weißt du ’s. Weicht das Herz der Leidenscaft Gewalt

                        
So stürmt und tobt es drinn: Da folgt Verzweiflung bald

                        
Auf süßer Hoffnung Glück das immer kurz dauert,

                        
Und dessen schnelle Flucht das Herz umsonst betrauert.

Es währte doch, auf Ehre,

                        
Zu lang des Manns Gespräch. Das ging in einem fort!

                        
Bei solchen Rednern kömmt der Hörer nie zum Wort.

                        
Er spricht wohl nicht so schlecht, der Rathsherr. Die Gedanken

                        
Sind komisch; wenn er nur nicht des Geschmackes Schranken

                        
Zuweilen überschritt’, ich hört’ ihn gerne an;

                        
Denn, wahrlich, er ist sonst ein recht verständ’ger Mann.

                        
Schon die Gestalt nimmt ein, die stattlichen Manieren,

                        
Der hohe Leibeswuchs, die Kleider selbst, sie zieren

                        
Den Greisen, er ist noch vom alten, kräft’gen Schlag.

Der Bürger ehrenvoll und schlicht und recht zu leben!

                        
Der alten Treue Sinn, er waltet stets noch hier;

                        
Gefühl für Bürgerwert, Freimütigkeit, die Zier

                        
Des Völkerstamms am Rhein und kraftvoll frohes Treiben

                        
Sind hier so recht zu Haus, und nie ließ sich beschreiben

                        
Wie sich der edle Trieb des Wohltums allgemein

                        
In allen Klassen zeigt. In lieblichem Verein

                        
Steht Bildung bei den Frau’n mit offner Herzensgüte;

                        
Es prangt die Mädchenwelt mit holder Schönheit Blüte

                        
Und unbefangnem Sinn; der rege Kunstfleiß beut

                        
Des Wohlstands goldne Frucht, und die Gelehrsamkeit

                        
Schmückt seit Jahrhunderten zu Straßburgs schönstem Glanze

                        
Sein altes Wappenschild mit ihrem Palmenkranze.

                        
Die Sprache selbst, wenn auch uns Fremden seltsam neu,

                        
Klingt herzlich und naiv, die Tochter alter Treu’

                        
Und ungekünstelter und freier Lebensweise.

                        
So sprach man schon am Rhein als dort mit kühnem Fleiße,

                        
Erwin den Riesenbau des Münsterdoms begann.

                        
Die Sprache war dies einst der ersten Minnesinger;

                        
Es schwur hier früher so der eine Karolinger

                        
Dem andern Treue zu, und längst um Klodwichs Thron

                        
Ertönt’ mit edler Kraft die alte Sprache schon.

                        
Noch spricht der Schweizer so; noch lebt in Schwabens Auen

                        
Die gleiche Mundart fort; noch auf des Schwarzwalds Gauen.

Es sei mein künft’ger Herd in dieser Stadt gebaut,

                        
So will es mein Entschluss. Sie werde meine Braut,

                        
So spricht mein Herz bald leis und bald mit wildem Pochen.

                        
O Himmel! Welches Glück, wenn nun nach wen’gen Wochen

                        
Der Liebe Seligkeit das Haus zum Tempel weiht,

                        
Das ihr und mir vereint ein bleibend Obdach leiht.

Die Hand ihm drückten, kannt’ er sich nicht mehr vor Freude,

                        
Und eine Träne quoll ihm aus dem Aug hervor.

Aber wie ich stille stand

                        
Fern der Zauberklang verschwand.

Rastlos eilt’ ich längs dem Bach

                        
Dem Gesang, dem flieh’nden, nach.

                        
Und des Baches leises Rieseln

                        
Gattet’ mit den Tönen sich

                        
Bis dem Tropfenfall auf Kieseln

Schnell der Töne Melodien,

                        
Nur die wilden Bienen summten

                        
Un des Waldes Vögel schrien,

                        
Und es ward die finstre Nacht

                        
Einsam in dem Wald durchwacht.

                        
Erst als ich in ’s Reich der Träume

Schwellend her und strömend hin,

                        
Hört’ ich ihn bald nah’n, bald flieh’n.

                        
Und die Silberstimmen sangen:

                        
Nicht die Mühe, nur das Glück,

                        
Hilft dir zu uns zu gelangen,

                        
Bringt dich auf die Spur zurück.

Einst wirst du uns wieder hören,

Wirst du wieder dich uns nahn.

                        
Nun muß ich mit Sehnsucht klagen

                        
Alles um mich her ist stumm,

                        
Nach will ich den Tönen jagen,

Was des Herzens kühnste Wünsche wagen

                        
Hat gespendet mir des Himmels Huld:

                        
Seligkeit auf folterndes Verzagen,

                        
Wonn’ auf der Verzweiflung Schuld.

                        
Gnädig trat mit goldenem Göttersegen

                        
Die Gewährung, hoch vom Felsentron,

Und der Nacht Gespenster flohn.

                        
Und der Schönheit Zauberblütenstengel

                        
Flocht sie hold in meiner Liebe Kranz,

                        
Und die süße Braut umstrahlt als Engel

                        
Mich mit überird’schem Glanz.

                        
Tausendfach durchströmt der Duft der Blüten

                        
Nun des Tags ätberischglüh’nden Schein,

Welches nicht mehr, eine läst’ge Bürde,

                        
Nieder mich zur Erde drückt.

                        
Wundersam verliert sich in Gefühlen

                        
Der Unendlichkeit die Liebe nun.

Grabe bei Ihr ewig ruhn!

                        
So ruft laut das Herz auf dessen Saiten

                        
Stets die Trau’r sich mit der Luft vermählt,

                        
Weil den kurzen Erdenseligkeiten

                        
Der Vollendung Weihe fehlt.

                        
Un verstummt tritt die Empfindung wieder

                        
In die Tiefen des Gemüts zurück:

                        
Dann der Aufschwung selbst der höchsten Lieder

                        
Schildert nie der Liebe Glück.

O dreifach süßer Gang! Wir schreiten hin berühret

                        
Von Amor’s Myrrthenstab den froh die Treue schwingt!

Wenn Herzen gleichgestimmt der Liebe Glut durchdringt,

                        
So wird des Lebens Pflicht zum heitern, leichten Spiele,

                        
Und wie am ersten Tag blüht duftend noch am Ziele

                        
Der Laufbahn, wundervol, der geist’gen Jugend Kranz.
